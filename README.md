Want to use a password manager, or type in your password using the keyboard under your fingertips, and not the on-screen one on TreasuryDirect.gov?

This user script is for you.

## Prerequisites

1) You will need a user script manager installed on the browser you wish to use to login to TreasuryDirect.gov
